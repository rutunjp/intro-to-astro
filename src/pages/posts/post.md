## Rotaract: The Service Club for Young Professionals

Rotaract is a service club for young professionals aged 18-30 who are interested in making a difference in their communities. It is sponsored by Rotary International, a global organization of business and professional leaders who are committed to community service.

Rotaract clubs typically meet once a week to discuss upcoming projects and events, and to plan how they can best serve their communities. Some of the common activities that Rotaract clubs participate in include:

- Organizing blood drives
- Cleaning up parks and beaches
- Volunteering at soup kitchens and homeless shelters
- Planting trees
- Tutoring children
- Fundraising for local charities

Rotaract is a great way to meet new people, learn new skills, and make a positive impact on your community. It is also a great way to network with other young professionals and to advance your career.

### Here are some tips for being a successful Rotaract member:

- **Get involved in your club.** The more involved you are, the more you will get out of your Rotaract experience. Attend meetings, volunteer for projects, and take on leadership roles.
- **Be open to new experiences.** Rotaract offers a wide variety of service projects and events. Try new things and step outside of your comfort zone.
- **Network with other members.** Rotaract is a great way to meet other young professionals from your community. Make an effort to get to know other members and to build relationships with them.
- **Have fun!** Rotaract is a service club, but it is also a social club. Enjoy getting to know other members and making a difference in your community.
